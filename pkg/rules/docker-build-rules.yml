# matrix field notes:
#   platform:    used by Docker to use the right architecture base image.
#                the set of supported values can be seen at:
#                  https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment
#                  from: https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64
#                  from: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/
#                one must also take any "normalization" into account, e.g. arm64v8 -> arm64, see:

#   shortname:   used by us to tag the architecture specific "manifest" image.
#   crosstarget: (optional) uUed to download the correct cross-compiled binary GitHub Actions artifact. Only used when
#                'mode' is 'copy'.
#   mode:        (optional) 'copy' (for cross-compiled targets) or 'build' (default). Passed through to the Dockerfile
#   cargo_args:  (optional) Pan be used when testing, e.g. set to '--no-default-features' to speed up the Krill
#                build. Passed through to the Dockerfile as build arg 'CARGO_ARGS'.
