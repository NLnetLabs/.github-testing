          # CentOS 8 became EOL and is in theory still usable as a build container as there is still a Docker image
          # available, and package installation can be done by switching the yum config in the container to use packages
          # from the CentOS 8 vault rather than the now offline actual CentOS 8 repository. However, due to experiencing
          # lots of timed out connections to the vault we will build the CentOS 8 compatible package in a Rocky Linux
          # container instead, as Rocky Linux is 100% compatible with CentOS 8. The server at packages.nlnetlabs.nl
          # however has a repo for CentOS 8, not Rocky Linux, and determines the repo to publish in based on the name of
          # the archive that we produce below which is in turn based by default on the container image used to build. We
          # therefore in this case need to specify that the O/S we are building for has a different name than the Docker
          # image we are building it in.
